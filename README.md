# Falcon 9 First Stage Reusability Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a successful return and reusability of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage. It leverages historical launch data to forecast outcomes, providing valuable insights into launch costs and efficiency. This analysis can be beneficial for entities assessing SpaceX's competitive edge in the aerospace market.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
This project utilizes several Python libraries for data handling, visualization, and machine learning:

- **Pandas**: A powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, ideal for processing and exploring complex datasets.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing, supporting large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing informative graphics.
- **Scikit-learn**: An essential tool for machine learning in Python, used for preprocessing data, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Machine Learning Models
i employed various machine learning models to predict the reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage:

- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification tasks.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: To classify launch data using a high-dimensional space.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: For creating models based on decision rules.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, yet effective model for classification based on proximity in feature space.
